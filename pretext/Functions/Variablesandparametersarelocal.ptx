  <title>Variables and parameters are local</title>
  <p>As has been discussed previously, when we use variables we have to first use assignment statements to create and give them value. Similarly, 
  we define functions in the code before the code can invoke them. Computer science uses the term <term>scope</term> to describe 
  where/when an identified item (like a variable, a function etc.) is recognizable and accessible. Calling a function or using a variable before
  its definition or assignment will trigger a runtime error because the item is outside of the program's scope at that moment.</p>
  <p>Scope becomes an even more important issue when large problems are decomposed with functions. Within
  a function, its parameters (and any other variable assigned a value in the function's body) can only be accessed by code within the same scope.
  These <term>local variables</term> only exists inside the function and you cannot use them outside of them. For example, consider again the <c>square</c> function:</p>

  <note>
    <p>We've ommitted the docstring, type annotations, and have used non-self-documenting names in the following example on purpose,
    to put you into a similar position as the code's interpreter - it can only 'do' what the code tells it to 
    and cannot 'know' what it is supposed to do. But it will follow the scope rules.</p>
  </note>
  <program xml:id="ac4_8_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def square(x):
    y = x * x
    return y

z = square(10)
print(y)
print(x)
print(z)

        </input>
  </program>
  
  <p>Examine the code on your own first. Make note of which variables are 'inside' the function's scope.</p>
  <p>Try running this in Codelens. When a function is invoked in Codelens, the local scope is separated from  the program's <term>global</term> scope by
      'Frame' boxes. Variables in the currently active <alert>local</alert> scope will be placed in a blue box while <term>global variables</term>
      will stay in the global frame. 
      Press the &#x2018;Next &gt;&gt;' button until you see an error message. When we try to use <c>y</c> on line 6 (outside the
            function) Python looks for a global variable named <c>y</c> but does not find one. This results in the runtime error:
            <c>Name Error: 'y' is not defined.</c></p>
  <p> <em>This is neither a syntax nor a semantic error - line 6 is syntactic and the algorithm is still valid </em> however...</p>

  <p>The variable <c>y</c> only exists while the function is being executed &#x2014; we call this its <term>lifetime</term>. When the
            execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed and the code passes outside of the function's scope. 
            CodeLens helps you visualize this
            because the function's local variables disappear after the function returns to the function caller's scope (line5). Go back and step through the statements paying
            particular attention to the variables that are created when the function is called and note when they are subsequently
            destroyed with the function's return.</p>

  <p>Within CodeLens, use <c>Edit this code</c> to delete line 6 <c>print(y)</c> and take a moment to work out for yourself what will now happen.
  Then <c>Visualize Execution</c> and proceed through all the steps. <em>What happened? Why?</em></p>

  <p>Hopefully you will have discovered that formal parameters are also local variables and their scope is limited to within their function. For example,
        the lifetime of <c>x</c> begins when
            <c>square</c> is called, and its lifetime ends when the function completes its execution and the scope passes back to the calling instruction.</p>
  <p>It is not possible for a function to set some local variable to a value, complete its execution, and then when it
            is called again next time, recover the local variable. Each call of the function creates new local variables, and
            their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller's scope.</p>
